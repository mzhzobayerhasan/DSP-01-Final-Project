# Energy Consumption and Traffic Density Prediction

This project implements a machine learning model for predicting **Energy Consumption** and **Traffic Density** based on multiple input features such as vehicle type, weather, economic condition, and more. The model uses **Random Forest Regression** and is designed for various industrial or transportation-related applications where such predictions are essential for optimizing resources, planning, and decision-making.

## Features

- **Energy Consumption Prediction**: Predicts the energy consumption based on factors like vehicle type, speed, weather, and economic condition.
- **Traffic Density Prediction**: Predicts traffic density (congestion) using input factors such as vehicle type, weather, and time of day.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
